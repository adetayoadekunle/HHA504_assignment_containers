## Deployment Process:
The deployment experience of containerizing a simple application with docker and deploying it on GCP Cloud Run was smooth. I created the docker image and started to run it on Google Shell where I used Python and HTML to produce a picture of a mountain (main route) and another webpage (random route) showing a random number selection and a hyperlink to go back to the mountain picture (homepage). This led to pushing the docker image to DockerHub and deploying the containerized application to GCP Cloud Run. I created two versions of the app (flask-504-example) with the first app just containing the picture and the second version with the headings with the image and the different webpage with the random number selection. The GCP Cloud run was also easy to use with just having to change the number from 504docker:v1 to 504docker:v2 to redeploy a new version (flask-504-example) and select the port of 5000. The interface was simplified and easy to customize. I had an overall great experience with the deployment process and now know the importance of deploying and managing containers with the GCP Cloud Run Container Apps.
